The Quantum dynamics or time evolution of a quantum state $| \Psi \rangle$ is a map that evolves into $| \tilde{\Psi} \rangle = U |\Psi \rangle$ also conserves probability because the time evolution operator U is unitary ($U^\dagger U =1$):
$\langle \tilde{\Psi} |  \tilde{\Psi} \rangle = \langle \Psi | U^\dagger U \Psi \rangle = \langle \Psi | \Psi \rangle = 1$ for any initial state $|\Psi \rangle$. In quantum computation all unitary transformations are allowed and represent valid quantum operations.

Examples:
- Transformations generated by a control Hamiltonian $H_C$ like external control fields (e.g. electromagnetic fields)

Basic unitary transformation on single qubits, pairs of qubits and an ensemble on qubits are called [[Single-qubit gates]], [[Two-qubit gates]] and [[n-qubit gates]]. 

The Schr√∂dinger equation is as follows (for $H$ time independent):
$- i \hbar \frac{d}{dt} | \Psi(t) \rangle = H | \Psi(t) \rangle$
with $| \Psi(t) \rangle = U(t) | \Psi(0) \rangle$
and $U(t) = \exp\left(-\frac{i H t}{\hbar} \right)$
