The three-bit Toffoli Gate is a universal reversible logical gate: any reversible circuit can be built from Toffoli gates only. The NOT gate can be realized by $a=b=1$ and the AND gate by $c=0$

Its action is: Only if the first two input bits are set to 1, the gate inverts the third bit, otherwise the three bits remain all unchanged.

Non trivial action:
$110 \rightarrow 111$
$111 \rightarrow 110$
