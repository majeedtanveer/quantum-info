- Idealized or physical electronic devices that realize a Boolean function: a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs ($0/1 \mathrel{\widehat{=}}$ FALSE/TRUE) that produce a single binary output


#### Examples

#### Universality
There exists a minimal set of gates to implement any classical Boolean circuit. The set of gates are not unique, one example is {AND, NOT}. An example of a single gate that is universal is the NAND gate.

#### Irreversible Computation
The classical two-bit gates are essentially irreversible and non-invertible: for example from the output $a \oplus b$ of the XOR gate, it is impossible to determine what the inputs a and b were.
$\Rightarrow$ There is an irretrievable loss of information associated with the irreversible action of the XOR-gate, and other classical two-bit logic gates

#### Reversible Computation
The [[Toffoli Gate]] is reversible.
