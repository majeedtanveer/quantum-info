#### Complexity Class P
Problems for which finding a solution can be achieved in time that scales polynomials with the size of the problem
Examples:
- Eulerian Path Problem (KÃ¶nigsberg Bridge Problem)
#### Complexity Class NP
Problems for which a solution can be found by a non-deterministic (N) Turing machine in polynomial (P) time.

However, solutions can still be checked in polynomial time.

Examples:
- Hamiltonian Cycle Problem
- Finding a needle in a haystack
- Knapsack problem (NP-Complete)
- Sudoku

A problem B is NP-complete, if for any problem A in NP there exists a polynomial-time reduction from A to B

#### Complexity Class BQP
Bounded-error quantum polynomial time is the class of decision problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances.

Examples:
- [[Grover]]
