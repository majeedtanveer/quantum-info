The code distance $d$ is the smallest [[weight]] i.e. the number of physical qubits that a logical operator has support on.

- A distance-$d$ QEC code can correct $\lfloor{\frac{d-1}{2}}\rfloor$ errors.
- A distance-$d$ QEC code can detect $d-1$ errors.
- There exist weight-$d$ errors that directly induce an (undetectable) logical error
