If [[Product States]] are non-separable they are entangled. They can be semi entangled and fully entangled. All pure states that cannot be written as product states are entangled.

Bell states are examples of entangled states

### Bell states
Bell states are the simplest maximally entangled states. They form the Bell basis which is a four dimensional Hilbert Space for two qubits:
$|\Phi^+ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( |00 \rangle + | 11 \rangle)$ 
$|\Phi^- \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( |00 \rangle - | 11 \rangle)$ 
$|\Psi^+ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( |01 \rangle + | 10 \rangle)$ 
$|\Psi^- \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( |10 \rangle - | 01 \rangle)$
