- Planar (2D) lattice structures are suitable for **practical** realizations of topological [[Quantum Error Correction|QER]] codes.
- Planar surface code hosting **one logical** qubit: No periodic boundary conditions!

### Characteristics
- Logical $X_L$ ($Z_L$) operators need to start over opposite smooth (rough) boundaries of the lattice respectively.
- Thus these are non-contractible strings starting and ending at boundaries (topological property)
- They fulfill the anticommutation relation $\{X_L^{(1)},Z_L^{(1)}\}=0$ and commute with all stabilizers.
- 4-qubit plaquette and vector stabilizers in the bulk
- Reduced 3-qubit $X$-type and $Z$-type stabilizers at the smooth and rough boundaries

Minimal surface codes of distance $d=3$ (one arbitrary error correctable):

- 9 data qubits encoding one logical qubit
- Often displayed Together with 8 Ancilla qubits for the measurement of the 8 stabilizers:

 - One of the currently pursued codes for first generation of logical qubits (e.g. IBM, Google, academic groups)
