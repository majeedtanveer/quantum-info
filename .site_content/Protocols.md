## Prof Wegwejis
- General stuff/ less about formulas, writes complex formulas himself and lets you explain them
- We use the notation now:
	- observation test (instead of POVM)
	- effect/observation (instead of effect operator)
	- transformations (instad of kraus operators/ canonical coarse graining form)
		- pure transformation is one kraus operator
	- Correspondence between superoperators and bipartite operators (instead of Choi-Jamiolkowski)
	- Deterministic preparation= Normalized state  
	- Probabilistic preparation test =Sub-normalized states collected into an ensemble
	- Probabilistic observation test = Effects collected into a positive-operator-valued-measure (POVM), destructive measurement
	- Deterministic transformation = Channel or evolution 
	- Probabilistic transformation test = Operations collected into an instrument, measurement, transformation-valued measure
